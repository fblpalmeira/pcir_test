## Overview

`pcir` is an R package designed to help researchers and practitioners
calculate, compare, and visualize the Potential for Conflict Index
(PCI). The PCI is a descriptive statistical method used to enhance
understanding of outcomes in human dimensions research [(Manfredo et
al. 2003)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10871200304310)
and [(Vaske et
al. 2010)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01490401003712648).
The package will equip users with the tools required for calculating,
comparing, and graphing the potential for conflict. The concepts of
consensus and disagreement or conflict hold relevance across various
fields, including economics, political science, psychology, sociology,
and natural resources. It is worth noting that although PCI can
currently be computed using software such as Excel, SPSS, and SAS, there
is no dedicated R package available for conducting this specific
analysis.

## Theoretical approach

**Figure 1.** Likert scales of the Potential for Conflict Index (PCI).

## Workflow

Stages of the ‘pcir’ package: 1. Read the data input from the
interviews; 2. Count the frequencies of responses within each question /
Write [(Table
1)](https://github.com/fblpalmeira/pcir/blob/main/data/Table1.xlsx); 3.
Calculate the potential conflict index for each question / Write [(Table
2)](https://github.com/fblpalmeira/pcir/blob/main/data/Table2.xlsx); 4.
Create a bubble chart using the indices / Save [(Figure
1)](https://github.com/fblpalmeira/pcir/blob/main/data/output_pci.png).

## Features

- **`counting()`** summarize data by calculating counts, percentages,
  means, and standard deviations.

- **`pci()`** compute the Potential for Conflict Index from summary
  data.

- **`bubble()`** visualize PCI results using a bubble plot.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `pcir` directly from GitHub:

``` r
# Uncomment the line below if devtools is not installed
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("fblpalmeira/pcir")
```

## Usage

Load the package if pcir is already installed.

``` r
# Load the Package:
library(pcir)
```

``` r
# Example dataset:
df1 <- data.frame(
  A = c(-1, 2, 2, 3, -1),
  B = c(-1, 2, 3, -1, 2),
  C = c(1, 2, -2, 3, -1),
  D = c(3, 2, 1, -1, -2),
  E = c(2, 3, 1, -1, -3)
  )
```

Counting function:

``` r
# The counting function summarizes data by counts, percentages, means, and standard deviations
df_count <- counting(df1)
df_count
```

PCI function:

``` r
# The pci function calculates the Potential for Conflict Index (PCI)
df_pci <- pci(df_count)
df_pci
```

Bubble plot function:

``` r
# The bubble function creates a bubble plot to visualize the PCI results
bubble_plot <- bubble(df_pci)
bubble_plot # Display the bubble plot
```
